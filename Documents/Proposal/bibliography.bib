@article{Kessels2006,
abstract = {To date, no attempt has been made to design efficient choice experiments by means of the G- and V-optimality criteria. These criteria are known to make precise response predictions, which is exactly what choice experiments aim to do. In this article, the authors elaborate on the G- and V-optimality criteria for the multinomial logit model and compare their prediction performances with those of the D- and A-optimality criteria. They make use of Bayesian design methods that integrate the optimality criteria over a prior distribution of likely parameter values. They employ a modified Fedorov algorithm to generate the optimal choice designs. They also discuss other aspects of the designs, such as level overlap, utility balance, estimation performance, and computational effectiveness.},

@article{Yu2011,
abstract = {We propose an efficient individually adapted sequential Bayesian approach for constructing conjoint-choice experiments, which uses Bayesian updating, a Bayesian analysis, and a Bayesian design criterion to generate a conjoint-choice design for each individual respondent based on the previous answers of that particular respondent. The proposed design approach is compared with three non-adaptive design approaches, two aggregate-customization approaches (based on the conditional logit model and on a mixed logit model), and the (nearly) orthogonal design approach, under various degrees of response accuracy and consumer heterogeneity. A simulation study shows that the individually adapted sequential Bayesian conjoint-choice designs perform better than the benchmark approaches in all scenarios we investigated in terms of the efficient estimation of individual-level part-worths and the prediction of individual choices. In the presence of high consumer heterogeneity, the improvements are impressive. The new method also performs well when the response accuracy is low, in contrast with the recently proposed adaptive polyhedral approach. Furthermore, the new methodology yields precise population-level parameter estimates, even though the design criterion focuses on the individual-level parameters.},

@article{Crabbe2014,
abstract = {The mixed logit choice model has become the common standard to analyze transport behavior. Moreover, more and more transport studies start to make use of stated preference data to obtain precise knowledge on travelers' preferences. Accounting for the individual-specific coefficients in the mixed logit choice model, this research advocates an individualized design approach to generate these stated choice experiments. Individualized designs are sequentially generated for each person separately, using the answers from previous choice sets to select the next best set in a survey. In this way they are adapted to the specific preferences of an individual and therefore more efficient than an aggregate design. In order for individual sequential designs to be practicable, the speed of designing an additional choice set in an experiment is obviously a key issue. This paper introduces three design criteria used in optimal test design, based on Kullback-Leibler information, and compares them with the well known D-efficiency criterion to obtain individually adapted choice designs for the mixed logit choice model. Being equally efficient to D-efficiency and at the same time much faster, the Kullback-Leibler criteria are well suited for the design of individualized choice experiments.},
