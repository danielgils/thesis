Fast generation of individualized designs for the mixed logit choice model
by Marjolein Crabbe, Deniz Akinc and Martina Vandebroek
in Transportation Research Part B, 2014.


The dataset lat.sas7bdat contains "extensible shifted lattice points with Baker's transformation" that are used to approximate the semi-Bayesian design criterion.
